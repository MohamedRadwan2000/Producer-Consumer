Design patterns used
  1.Producer Consumer : the machine contains a producer part and a consumer part where the product is passed between them.

  2.Snapshot : we save a snapshot of the machines every sec and save this to an array List then if we need to replay, we rerun it again

  3.Observer : when a machine producer produces roducts, it notifies the machine consumer to consume it and vice versa
